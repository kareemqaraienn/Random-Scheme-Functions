# Scheme ranom functions
This repository contains the solutions to some problems assigned in Assignment 3 of the course CSI2120 Programming Paradigm at the University of Ottawa. The solutions are implemented in Scheme.

Question 1
The function lowest-exponent takes a base integer and a target natural number bound as parameters, and returns the lowest positive integer (exponent) for which base^exponent >= bound.

Question 2
The function find-abundant takes a positive integer as parameter, and produces a list of all abundant numbers no greater than the given one, in order from the largest to the smallest.

Question 3
The function make-string-list takes a natural number n as parameter, and returns a list of strings. The first string in the list should be the string "n seconds", the second string in the list should be the string "(n-1) seconds" and so on. The second to last string in the list should be "1 second", and the last string in the list should be "Finished".

These functions were tested using the sample inputs provided in the questions.
